## Principles
1. Follow Rust idioms
2. Use strong typing and Results for error handling
3. Leverage Rust's ownership model for memory safety
4. Use traits to define interfaces between components
5. Implement concurrency with Rust's safety guarantees
6. Focus on minimalism and performance
7. Avoid scope creap and bloat.
8. Avoid overengineering solutions.
9. Use proper rust file and directory structure according to Rust best practices.
10. This is a small hobby project maintained by a single develper. The project scope should reflect this.
11. Keep rust files small for easier editing. Under 300 lines.
12. Refactor larger rust files. Logically split them up for easier editing.
13. Look in docs/ for documentation.
