# Recommendations

## Core Architectural Refactoring

### 1. Eliminate Cross-Language Complexity
*Addresses Issue #1: Complex State Management Across Languages*
- Move ALL functionality to Python, eliminating bash layer entirely
- Port existing encoding strategy logic to Python classes
- Use ffmpeg-python for direct ffmpeg integration
- Implement all process management in Python
- Maintain clean subprocess management without PTY

### 2. Establish Reliable Communication
*Addresses Issue #2: Fragile Communication Channels*
- Event-based status updates
- Structured logging system
- Remove ALL environment variable dependencies
- Remove file-based communication
- Direct function calls for internal communication
- Standardized process output handling
- Clear streaming of status and progress data

### 3. Centralize State Management
*Addresses Issue #3: Multiple Sources of Truth*
- Implement centralized in-memory state management
- Use proper Python data structures for state tracking
- Atomic state updates with validation
- Clear state boundaries between components
- Simple file-based persistence only when needed for recovery
- Unified segment tracking and management
- Single source for encoding progress state

### 4. Robust Process Management
*Addresses Issue #4: Error-Prone Process Management*
- Direct process management without PTY/bash
- Clean process lifecycle management
- Proper signal handling and cleanup
- Clear process hierarchies
- Automatic resource cleanup

### 5. Supporting Infrastructure

#### Configuration System
- Centralized configuration management
- Type-safe configuration objects
- Clear configuration validation
- Proper default handling
- Configuration documentation

#### Directory Structure
- Single temporary directory tree
- Consistent naming conventions
- Automated cleanup procedures
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper resource isolation

#### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration test suite
- Process management tests
- State management tests
- Error handling validation

#### Documentation Standards
- Clear API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Development guidelines
- Testing documentation
- Deployment guides
