# Architecture Overview

## Configuration System

The configuration system is a foundational component that provides type-safe, centralized configuration management. It follows these key principles:

1. **Type Safety**
   - All configuration values have explicit types
   - Configuration classes use dataclasses for type enforcement
   - Runtime validation ensures type correctness

2. **Centralization**
   - Single source of truth for all settings
   - Environment variables managed through config
   - Path management unified in one place
   - Process settings standardized

3. **Validation**
   - All configuration values validated at creation
   - Path existence checks where required
   - Type checking for all values
   - Reasonable defaults provided

4. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new configuration categories
   - Simple to override defaults
   - Clear validation rules
   - Documentation for all options

The configuration system is used by all other components to ensure consistent settings and behavior across the application.
