//! Tests for video property detection functionality
//!
//! These tests verify:
//! - Generation of proper crop filters based on video black borders
//! - Handling of invalid file paths and non-existent files
//! - Safe execution with disable flags for command operations
//! - Integration with system tools (mediainfo, FFmpeg)
//!
//! Note: Some tests that require external commands are ignored by default
//! and can be run manually with the --ignored flag.
