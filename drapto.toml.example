# Drapto Configuration Example
# 
# This is an example configuration file for drapto. You can use this as a starting point
# for your own configuration. Copy this file to drapto.toml and modify it to suit your needs.

# All settings have sensible defaults, so you only need to set values that differ from defaults.
# Settings can also be overridden with environment variables like DRAPTO_SCENE_THRESHOLD=35.0
